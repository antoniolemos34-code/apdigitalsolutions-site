    <h2>Why most commercial cleaning companies struggle on Google Maps</h2>

    <p>
      Many commercial cleaning companies rely on referrals, tender platforms or existing contracts.
      But when potential clients search for “office cleaning company near me” or
      “commercial cleaning Birmingham”, they often don’t appear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Common issues include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Incorrect primary category</li>
      <li>Weak service area configuration</li>
      <li>No keyword alignment in services</li>
      <li>Low review volume or no commercial-focused reviews</li>
      <li>Poor call and enquiry conversion path</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What actually improves Google Maps visibility</h2>

    <h3>1. Correct commercial intent positioning</h3>
    <p>
      Your Google Business Profile must reflect commercial intent — office contracts,
      industrial cleaning, facilities support — not just generic “cleaning services”.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Category and service precision</h3>
    <p>
      Aligning categories and services with real commercial search queries increases relevance.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Review strategy aligned to commercial clients</h3>
    <p>
      Reviews mentioning offices, warehouses or contract cleaning improve trust signals
      and influence conversion.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Conversion optimisation</h3>
    <p>
      Visibility without action is wasted. We optimise the call and enquiry path
      so profile views convert into enquiries.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>How long does it take to improve rankings?</h3>
    <p>
      Improvements typically begin within weeks, but strong positioning takes consistency
      and ongoing optimisation.
    </p>

    <h3>Do commercial cleaning companies need a website?</h3>
    <p>
      A website strengthens authority and conversion, but Google Business Profile optimisation
      alone can significantly improve visibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Is Google Ads necessary?</h3>
    <p>
      Ads can accelerate growth, but the foundation should always be a properly structured
      and optimised Google Business Profile.
