      Client: Local wellness service business

    <h2 class="h2">The Situation</h2>
    <p class="p">
      When the client started working with me, their Google Business Profile was incomplete and not strategically optimised.
      Categories were not aligned with real search behaviour, services were not structured properly,
      and local search positioning was weak.
      As a result, the business was barely appearing for relevant “service + city” searches.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2">What Was Done</h2>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>Full Google Business Profile audit and optimisation</li>
      <li>Correct primary and secondary categories</li>
      <li>Structured services aligned with real search terms</li>
      <li>Improved business description for local relevance</li>
      <li>Trust signal optimisation (photos & completeness)</li>
      <li>Conversion-focused improvements (calls & messaging)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2">The Result</h2>
    <p class="p">
      Within days, the business started appearing for relevant local searches including:
    </p>

    <ul class="ul">
      <li>Service + City searches</li>
      <li>“Near me” searches</li>
      <li>Category-based local queries</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="p">
      The client reported improved visibility, increased profile activity,
      and stronger professional credibility online.

    <h2 class="h2">Client Feedback</h2>

    <div class="card pad">
      <p class="p">
        “When I started working with Antonio, I had almost no structured online presence.
        He handled everything: organising and optimising my Google profile,
        structuring my services, improving descriptions, aligning keywords,
        and positioning the business strategically for local searches.
        Within days, I started appearing when people searched for my services locally.
        Today, my business feels visible and professional online.”
